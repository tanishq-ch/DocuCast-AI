## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10+
*   Git

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the project to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanishq-ch/AI-PDF---To---Podcast-Creator.git
cd AI-Podcast-Creator
```

### 3. Set Up the Environment

Create a Python virtual environment and activate it.

*   **On Windows:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

*   **On macOS/Linux:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install all the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file. This command uses an extra index for the specific PyTorch version needed.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your secret keys.

```env
# Generate a new secret key for Flask sessions
SECRET_KEY='a_very_long_random_string'

# Add your Google Gemini API Key
GEMINI_API_KEY='your_google_gemini_api_key_here'
```

### 6. Set Up the Database

Initialize and upgrade the database to create the necessary tables.
```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
flask db upgrade
```
*(Note: If the `migrations` folder already exists, you can skip `flask db init`.)*

### 7. Run the Application

Launch the Flask development server.
```bash
flask run
```
The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## üöÄ How It Works: The AI Pipeline

1.  **Upload:** A user uploads a PDF or TXT file.
2.  **Text Extraction:** `PyMuPDF` reads the file and extracts all text content.
3.  **Script Generation:** The extracted text is sent to the **Gemini API** with a carefully crafted prompt, asking it to create a conversational script between a "Host" and an "Expert".
4.  **Sentence Splitting:** The generated script is broken down into individual sentences using `NLTK` to ensure the TTS engine receives manageable chunks of text.
5.  **Voice Synthesis:** For each sentence, **KittenTTS** generates a `.wav` audio clip using a different pre-defined voice for the Host and the Expert.
6.  **Audio Assembly:** `pydub` stitches all the individual `.wav` clips together, adding short pauses between them, and exports the final product as a single `.mp3` file.
7.  **Completion:** The database is updated with the "Completed" status and the path to the final `.mp3` file, which the user can then download.
